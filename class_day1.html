    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        hello my name is upasana. <br> I am practising html 
    </p>
    <h2>heading 2</h2>
    <p>we use p tag for paragraph br tag to break <br>this must be in second line. next is pre tag which represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. <br>
    <pre>
        this gap is seen               as it is in html page
    </pre> <br> we use &nbsp (non break space) which give single space without breaking line. to see this example &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp we are using three space</p>
    
    
    <p> b tag is used to <b>bold word. </b> u tag is used to <u>underline word</u>. i tag is used to <i>itallic word</i></p>
    <p>This is example for subscript.Eg- H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This is example for superscript.Eg- a<sup>2</sup>+ b <sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>This is an example of <s>StrikeThrough</s></p>
